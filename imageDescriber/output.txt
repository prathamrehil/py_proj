Consider three planes intersecting at a point O 
such that these three planes are mutually 
perpendicular to each other (Fig 11.1).

Given a point  P in space,  we drop  a 
perpendicular PM on the XY-plane with M as the 
Fig 11.2 
foot of this perpendicular (Fig 11.2).

Alternatively, through the point P in the 
space, we draw three planes parallel to the 
coordinate planes, meeting the x-axis, y-axis 
and z-axis in the points A, B and C, respectively 
(Fig 11.3).

Let P(x1, y1, z1) and Q ( x2, y2, z2) 
be two points referred to a system of 
rectangular axes OX, OY and OZ. 
Through the points P and Q draw planes 
parallel to the coordinate planes so as to 
form a rectangular parallelopiped with one 
diagonal PQ (Fig 11.4).
